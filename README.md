## I am a Musician Computer Scientist

- :wrench: Currently working as Software/Data Engineer @ [ABN Amro]([https://www.abnamro.nl/nl/zakelijk/index.html](https://github.com/abnamro)) 
- :books: Graduated in Computer Science @ Politecnico di Milano with particular focus on AI/ML and audio applications.
- üí™üèº Future Goals: writing code while jammin with my guitar
- ‚ö°  Fun fact: I am studying engineering because I am a musician. I started playing the guitar when I was 10 years old, then I decided to study electronics in high school and computer science in university to be able to understand also the technology involved in the music industry (weird ah?)
